A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity       in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well       dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply astounding.       His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was       new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on—and it       was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a       citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals.

He knew that a       yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but       he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death       and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he       would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how       would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river,       dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would       throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her       lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse       him any more!

And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he       could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight       intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently,       when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home       again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and       moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and       sunshine in at the other.

The basin was refilled, and this time he       stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath       and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and       groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and       water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he       was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his       chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a       dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and       backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done       with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his       saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a       dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the       curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his       head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with       bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used       only on Sundays during two years—they were simply called his “other       clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The       girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself; she       buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar       down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled       straw hat.

They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.       Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some       small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as       they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen       minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and       noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the       first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered;       then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy’s hair in the       next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck       a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say “Ouch!”       and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole class were of       a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite       their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be       prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward—in       small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue       ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled       a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a       yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly       bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many       of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two       thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two       Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of two years—and a       boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three       thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties       was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth—a       grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before       company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy       come out and “spread himself.” Only the older pupils managed       to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a       Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and       noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous       for that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart was fired with a       fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that       Tom’s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those       prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for       the glory and the eclat that came with it.

Tom was therefore elevated to a place with       the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from       headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so       profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial       one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place       of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that suffered       the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves       had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the       wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised       themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the       grass.

Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a       large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he       called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did       was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went       floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went       into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless       legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe       out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in       the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came       idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet,       weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping       tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at       it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a       closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just       missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion;       subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued       his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and       absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended       and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of       the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and       lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle       inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was       entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there       was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to       the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every       point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the       creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking       his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a       while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an       ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that;       yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there       was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the       yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the       altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he       clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till       presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and       the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course,       and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and       the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and       waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be       nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would       have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he       might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything       was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely       perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock       began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously.       The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured,       muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the tiresome       chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next       the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed’s head       made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.       Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by       a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he       was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze,       in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And       then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy       caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of       “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against       the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single       minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the       roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d”       with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the       woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his       dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of       half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.

He began to find himself hanging around her       father’s house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill.       What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer       took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone;       there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;       there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to       try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are       infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing       health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things.       When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away,       to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else       that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the “Health”       periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were       inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they       contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and       what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what       frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing to       wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her       health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had       recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the       day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her       quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went       about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with “hell       following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an angel       of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.

It was noticed that this strange thing       had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung       about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He       was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking       everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.       Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he       gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom       accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark       about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and       watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the       owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks       ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the       empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at       the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he       was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing,       chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing       handsprings, standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he       could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if       Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all;       she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was       there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came       war-whooping around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of       the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every       direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost       upsetting her—and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard       her say: “Mf! some people think they’re mighty smart—always       showing off!”     ", "length": 1490, "emotion": {"nervous": 0.054417814842895436, "disgust": 0.15214027832714566, "grief": 0.1591089645254134, "embarrassment": 0.08064552198556399, "sadness": 0.37126092933958865}, "color": "#000000", "weather": "rain"}, {"cfi": "/6/34!/4/86", "content": "       Tom’s cheeks burned.

They made an imposing       adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and       suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary       dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe”       stirred, to “let him have it to the hilt,” because “dead       men tell no tales.” They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all       down at the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was       no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.

The river was not high, so there was       not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during       the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the       distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,       peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,       unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger       stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the       scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she”       could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with       dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was       but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island       beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last”       with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their       last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the       current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the       danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the       morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of       the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their       freight. Part of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old       sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter       their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good       weather, as became outlaws.

The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more       difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and       lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel       and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but       they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call       down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they       reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder       came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They       began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and       next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They       tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined       sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be       appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that       there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was       only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such valuables       was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that in       the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the       business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of       stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously       inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.

The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded       itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy       leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and       “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he was       measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord,       he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns,       as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere;       and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in       the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and began a       journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that he       was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a       doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from       nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully       by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged       it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy       height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, “Lady-bug,       lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children’s       alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which       did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was       credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity       more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and       Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and       pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird,       the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled out       her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill       jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within       the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers       with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the       “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to       inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never       seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.       All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight       pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies       came fluttering upon the scene.

The       boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming       thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly.

The tempest rose higher and       higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went       winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others’ hands and       fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that       stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest.

The denial only seemed to       make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that,       and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not       certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to get up       and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced herself to       keep still—because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell       about me tearing the picture sure.

Mr.       Dobbins’ lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he       carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only       reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle.

During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s       condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so       high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the       looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.       At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom       was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his       resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and       died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.

There was one very       strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the quantity of       coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as much as       fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and       station in life, in that he imagined that all references to “hundreds”       and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that       no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a       moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual       money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure had       been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real       dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.

Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was       a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an       opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred.       Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature       with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and       mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green       valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly       wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted       there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant       defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and       then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things       have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent       of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the       lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead.       This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps       other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for       McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran       into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might       wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and       chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and       down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth       under labyrinth, and no end to any of them.

Presently the       hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal       until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered       down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled       webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the       rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and       talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave       whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an       overhanging shelf and moved on.

Tom squeezed his small       body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification.

They wound this way and that, far       down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched       off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place       they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of       shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man’s leg;       they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by       one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought       them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of       glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were       supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining       of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless       water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed       themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the       creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting       furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort       of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and hurried her into the first       corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky’s       light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats       chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every       new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom       found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away       until its shape was lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders,       but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first.       Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy       hand upon the spirits of the children.

In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly       growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a       stalactite overhead.

That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy       fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified;       when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when       the massacre at Lexington was “news.”     ", "length": 1404, "emotion": {"disgust": 0.06743272801915197, "grief": 0.8330711302538899, "sorrow": 0.012077035768369802, "sadness": 0.021586881214176516, "remorse": 0.010435668262653797}, "color": "#000000", "weather": "rain"}, {"cfi": "/6/76!/4/24", "content": " ", "length": 0, "emotion": {"pride": 0.020830125474241724, "excitement": 0.02983837984079862, "realization": 0.12304324500437022, "surprise": 0.1458906661204285, "neutral": 0.16769778735179133}, "color": "#000000", "weather": "rain"}, {"cfi": "/6/76!/4/28", "content": " ", "length": 0, "emotion": {"pride": 0.020830125474241724, "excitement": 0.02983837984079862, "realization": 0.12304324500437022, "surprise": 0.1458906661204285, "neutral": 0.16769778735179133}, "color": "#000000", "weather": "rain"}, {"cfi": "/6/76!/4/30", "content": "       It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall       have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,       and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion.
